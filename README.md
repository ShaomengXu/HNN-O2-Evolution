The compressed package contains four files: The 'ipynb' file is the main code section of the article, which can be successfully run in a Jupyter Notebook with the torch package installed; the remaining three 'CSV' files are respectively the data used for training the model, the descriptor data for 15 new catalysts to be predicted, and the data for predicting the FeCoLa phase diagram. The above CSV files are operated according to the model construction process for the Tafel slope. To run the onset overpotential, the first five columns of descriptors in the CSV files need to be arranged according to the description in the article.
